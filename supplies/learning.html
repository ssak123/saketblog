	   	<hr>

Learning a language <br>
Is like solving a riddle<br>
With a thousand clues<br>
About an ever changing subject.<br>
It’s like getting lost in a foreign city <br>
Without a map.<br>
It’s like a test without a grader, <br>
An student without a teacher,<br>
A course without an exam.<br>
<br><br>
But then gradually<br>
It’s like being out in a early morning<br>
When the mist lifts<br>
It’s like a sliver of light under a door<br>
Catching the train you were going to miss<br>
Getting an unexpected present <br>
And exchanging a smile.<br>
<br><br>
In the first part of this poem, I aimed to express the lack of a realized goal when starting out as a language learner. For a while, learning a language can feel as though one is meandering through a maze of vocabulary and grammar rules, with a lack of concrete progress. This “wall” is the main reason learners give up halfway through their studies, as they mistake their lack of progress for a lack of talent. This “wall” can indeed be tough to overcome, but once you do, you realize the true beauty in learning a foreign language. Most people start to overcome the wall after they grasp enough of the language to start communicating with native speakers. My aim with the second part of the poem was to portray the beauty of the other side of the wall, which I believe I did.

Foreign language<br>
Is a river that runs in parallel<br>
To one's mother tongue.<br>
Every time one learns a new word and its meaning<br>
They dig a canal between them.<br>
And when one knows all that can be known<br>
They can swim together in the open lake.<br>
 <br><br>
In this poem, I wanted to illustrate the similarities between different languages, while also recognizing each of their uniquenesses. The two languages being compared in the poem start out as two distinct rivers, running in the same direction. This describes the distinctness of each language, paying homage to the authenticity and natural differences of every language. However, the same direction of flow signifies the common purpose of all languages: to facilitate communication. The creation of canals between the two rivers represent the cross-cultural communication that learning a language encourages. The lake at the end of the poem serves to show that the language learner now has a double identity, being a bridge between the language they learned and their mother tongue. This poem is representative of my experience learning languages. I have noticed that speakers treat me as a representative of India, and my habits and behavior tends to be treated as the behavior of India as a whole. This is why I alluded to the “bridge between identities” in the poem.

		   	On average, it takes a person from 25 to 88 weeks of pure, uninterrupted study to become conversationally fluent in a language. The time it takes is heavily dependent on the difficulty of the language as well as the similarities in grammar and vocabulary. The amount of studying is also dependent on the learner’s familiarity with language learning, and whether they are currently bilingual or not. In the summer of 2018, I decided to take on one of the hardest languages for English speakers: Japanese. As someone who had only minimally studied Spanish as a hobby, my experience with language learning was also limited. I had seen several language blogs warning me against learning Japanese as a second language, saying that it can take over 10 years without proper preparation. But, being a dumb 14 year old, I thought nothing of the warnings. Unphased by the odds stacked against me, I dived head first into the Japanese language. From there on, I can only describe the preceding month as a treacherous blur. Between memorizing ridiculously long conjugations and memorizing an ungodly amount of vocabulary, my brain sometimes felt like it was going to explode. However, I continued to persevere, and held on to my determination. And soon enough, the need for boring, rote memorization stopped, as I have managed to internalize the grammatical patterns and vocabulary after about half a year. This year, I am in my third year of study, and after learning how fun talking to people of a different culture can be, I can profoundly say that my dedication has paid off.

As a fellow at Princeton University, Ifemelu is a well-learned intellectual. However, even with such prestigious qualifications, she is naive about several things, from American racism to basic participation based classes. Within the theme of learning, Adichie mainly focuses on the American Dream.
  At the beginning of the book Ifemelu recounts the time she took the SAT stating that, “She took the SATs at a Lagos center, packed with thousands of people, all bristling with their own American ambitions.” In this quote, Ifemelu refers to the SAT takers as brimming with American ambitions. This section of the quote refers to the American Dream, where people from impoverished nations aim for the US as a hope to better their lives. Considering that people in Nigeria are taking the SAT, it can be assumed that they want to transfer into an American college, from which they can get a work visa and establish permanent residency. However, considering the fact that the US is still heavily biased against black folk, this situation can be seen as situational irony, as the nigerian students are trying to get into a place where they will only face discrimination. Of course, their quality of life will be better, but there will definitely be some unexpected side effects. That being said, Adichie also makes sure to show the positive side of the American dream: “SHE GOT an e-mail from a princeton.edu address and before she read it, her hands shook from excitement. The first word she saw was “pleased.”  This shows the meritocratic nature of American culture, which is considered a massive improvement versus the bureaucratic mess present in countries like Nigeria. Adichie also included school life snapshots, showing how America is an improvement to classes in Nigeria: “SCHOOL IN AMERICA was easy, assignments sent in by email, classrooms air conditioned, professors willing to give makeup tests. ”

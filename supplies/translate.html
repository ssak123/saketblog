Today was the day, I thought to myself. After nearly half a year of studying the Japanese language, today was the day I would finally make use of my newfound mastery. Like a mountain climber prepared to take his first step towards Mt. Fuji, I felt intense excitement, filled with confidence in my ability. Strangely, I also felt intimidated, which was weird considering the mountain was only about 7” tall, 4” wide, with about an inch depth. Renowned for being read “backward,” it was the Japanese version of comic books: manga. What lay before me was an old friend. Its cover featured a giant humanoid beast blanketed in thick steam, with the main character, Eren, charging toward it with blades in hand. At the very top of the book was the title, but instead of the name Attack on Titan I was familiar with, it was replaced by a string of foreign characters: 進撃の巨人 (Shingeki-no-Kyojin). Unphased, I marched forward, taking my first step up this mountain. As I turned to the first page, I marveled at the crisp monochromatic art style made up of hundreds of delicately placed pen strokes, every little detail, each panel adding to the characters’ raw emotions. Already intrigued by the illustrations, my eyes darted to the dialogue bubbles, hungry for the story. 
However, instead of seeing the descriptive dialogue I had come to expect, I was met with a completely blank canvas. Though my eyes registered the tiny blotches of ink, my mind refused to parse it, as if it were rejecting the dialogue. Only after intense research did I realize that this phenomenon had a name: Not Knowing Japanese. And according to my research assistant, google, there was one cure. Practice and perseverance. And practice and persevere I did. After months of consulting with Japanese friends and burying my head in dictionaries, I finished translating a volume of Attack on Titan. Thanks to this arduous climb, I learned the value of perseverance and dedication; this assisted me in several of my future endeavors.

	   	<p class="paragraph-text">In Japan, there exists a comedy format known as Manzai. Native to the bustling city of Osaka, it is a two man act involving two roles: a funny man (boke) and a straight man (tsukkomi) trading jokes at a fast speed. Their jokes often revolve around making light of a misunderstanding through the use of verbal puns, wordplay, and various other techniques. But most importantly, the act is delivered in the dialect native to Osaka: the Kansai Dialect. As someone speaking Japanese for their second language, puns and wordplay are hard enough on their own, but add the fast paced Kansai Dialect and you get what the professionals call “gibberish”. However, my love for comedy shows sparked a fire of conviction to be able to understand the show and laugh along with the audience of Osaka. I phoned my friend Akane, a person not from Osaka but familiar with its dialect, to teach me the secrets to learning it. Unfortunately, as I later learned, there weren’t too many secrets, as she only told me to practice. And practice I did. Within a few weeks, I had managed to learn a lot of the Kansai dialect and was able to watch the comedy routine without much difficulty.

	   	<p class="paragraph-text">  (This is a continuation of the last post.) After being exposed to the Manzai comedy style, I decided to translate a video of it and upload it to youtube, as I wanted to share the comedy style with a Western audience. Thus I set on yet another journey with Manzai, this time trying to translate it rather than understand it. Although I had plenty of experience with translating comic books and vlogs, this was the first time I was translating something as nuanced as a comedy. Therefore, in order to keep the nuance of the video, I had to be extra-careful in how I picked my words. You see, there is a fine line between creative writing and translating when trying to communicate nuance to an audience. Of course, having to change up a few words and or dropping some phrases is inevitable when trying to keep an audience entertained. But when the entire content of paragraphs start changing for the sake of audience enjoyment, that’s when you know that you’ve entered creative writing territory. And while attempting to translate the comedy, That was exactly the problem I kept on running into. The scenes were just so chock full of double meanings and puns that it was near impossible to translate without significant change to    <br><br><br></p>

		   Translating is the act of expressing a previously unintelligible text in an understandable form. Although Ifemelu does not literally translate things during the book, she metaphorically does several times. Within the theme of translating, Adichie mainly focuses on translating experiences of racism into something palatable to white people and finding comfort in her accent.
In chapter 37, Shan publishes a memoir about her experiences as a black woman in the US. Due to her editor’s constant hounding of her to tone down the role of racism in her life, she gets frustrated and exclaims, “You can't write an honest novel about race in this country.” Her editor takes the role of a translator in this context. Their job is to downplay the role racism plays in the life of African Americans in the United States, as to make white people feel less responsible for the misery of other minorities. In this case, a special type of translation, whitewashing, was used to make Shan’s book less accusatory, no matter how right she may be.
Near the beginning of the book, Ifemelu notices that Aunty Uju puts on a ,”nasal, sliding accent...put on when she spoke to white Americans, the presence of white Americans, in the hearing of white Americans” This is an example of Aunty Uju translating her accent for the sake of better relating with the white folk she works with. This translation comes not from a desire to communicate better, but instead from a place of insecurity about her accent and how it affects the impression white people get from her when talking to her. Adichie contrasts Aunty Uju with Ifemelu, who does the exact opposite and reclaims her accent after gaining confidence in her Nigerian self, saying, “...’there is nothing more beautiful than what God gave me.’ Ifemelu decided to stop faking an American accent on a sunlit day in July, the same day she met Blaine.” Adichie included this scene as to emphasise the lengths Aunty Uju was going to appease white people while also emphasising Ifemelu’s new identity as a proud Nigerian.

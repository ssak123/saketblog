	   	<hr>
	   	<p class="paragraph-text">
Discussing different cultures with foreigners can help give you an idea about how different America is from other countries. Living in one of the largest, most populous, and diverse countries in the world, us Americans can often forget about the utter scale of the world and the varying cultures that surround us. Due to the large melting pot of cultures that make up the American identity, it is easy for us to believe that we have seen it all. However, something us Americans often look over is linguistic diversity. In our single language environment, it is common to think that everyone is like us, having two national languages at most. This notion is completely false. I have friends from places such as Singapore, India, and Indonesia where there are dozens of national languages with millions of speakers, and it is necessary to speak 3, 4, even 5 languages. Within cultures such as this, languages such as English or French emerge as Lingua Francas, in order to be able to communicate without problems. Through interaction with various languages and their speakers, one can learn about the diversity in even seemingly homogenous nations and can gain new lenses through which they can inspect the world.

	   	<h1 class="title-text">Telugu Tango (248 words)</h1>
	   	<hr>
	   	<p class="paragraph-text">When I was in ninth grade, I was always surrounded by South Indians, specifically people who spoke Telugu as their first language. Whether it was sharing classes with them, celebrating Diwali together, or just being friends with them, it is undeniable that the Telugu people and their culture has had a significant impact on my identity as an Indian American. Which was one of the main reasons I decided to try to learn the Telugu language. As a speaker of Hindi, I thought that Telugu would be an easy language to put under my belt since it was another Indian language. Boy, was I wrong about that. Telugu and Hindi belong to completely different language families, Telugu being Dravidian and Hindi being Indo-European. Everything from the word order to the grammatical structure was completely different. Typically this would have been where I would have given up, being a lazy, uninspired teenager. However, as I recalled how overjoyed my friends were at someone else learning their language, I kept on trying. Anytime I would feel unmotivated, I would remind myself how learning the language had pulled me closer to the Telugu community, which had basically adopted me at that point. Today, I still only have the Telugu speaking skills of a five year old, but my bond with Cumming’s Telugu community remains as strong as ever. Although I have stopped learning the language as of now, the imprint it’s culture has left on me will remain with me forever.

	   	<h1 class="title-text">Korean Honorifics (201 words)</h1>
	   	<hr>
	   	<p class="paragraph-text">  When discussing politeness as a grammatical entity in the Korean language with my Korean friends, I am repeatedly dumbfounded by the sheer amount of honorifics and levels of polite language present in Korean. Honorifics change based on seniority, gender, age, wealth, marital status, even profession sometimes. Comparing this to the Mr., Mrs, Ms., and Dr. that dominates the American corporate landscape is like comparing a V12 engine to a skateboard: the difference in complexity is absurd. However, as I analyzed further about the different honorifics in each culture, I realized that honorifics are simply reflections of the social hierarchy of each culture. It's not that American honorifics are simpler than Korean ones for the sake of being simpler, it just doesn’t have as strict of a socioeconomic hierarchy as Korea. A more solid social structure in Korea led to the birth of honorifics that a socially freer America did not need. Through this analysis, I realized that cultures are reflected in their language, which in turn subconsciously influence people born and raised in those cultures. Through this experience, I learned about how cultures can affect one's upbringing and how some facts can be misconstrued to make incorrect assumptions about different cultures.   <br><br><br></p>

		   In the book Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie explores the hardships of daily immigrant life in America. The book often directly speaks to sensitive issues such as racism, the aftermath of colonization, and the mistreatment of immigrants in America. Adichie uses the main character, Ifemelu, as an instrument to show these issues through a first-hand lens. Within the theme of Culture, Adichie focuses on the Americanization of children, differences in culture and conformism, and perceptions of mental health in different cultures.
In chapter 10, Jane warns Ifemelu about the Americanization of children in the U.S. , “If you are not careful in this country, your children will become what you don't know.” This quote echoes a sentiment a lot of immigrant parents hold while raising their children in a foreign country. They want them to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them in these countries but do not want them to become Westernized/American. This can come from a desire to keep one's culture alive and intact for future generations away from home, or due to negative stereotypes about American culture. 
In chapter 11, Aunty Uju advises Ifemelu to straighten her hair, saying that, “If you have braids, they will think you are unprofessional.” The theme of hair comes up yet again. In America, a country heavily influenced by white european beauty standards, African women are expected to use chemical formula in order to relax their hair and straighten it out, appearing more white and by relation, more professional. In this case, making black women straighten their hair can strip them of their black identity, therefore making it a case of a dominant culture suppressing a minority culture, also known as erasure. 
In chapter 24, Ojiugo states, “These white people think that everybody has their mental problems.” This quote shines light onto the difference in treatment of mental illness depending on what cultural context it is put into. A Nigerian who is used to seeing misery on an everyday basis may believe that they have no right to feel sad about their current situation versus a more sheltered American being much more free with their emotions.

In a world of instant communication and constant cultural interactions, the globe is quickly becoming a borderless place. Boundaries between race, beliefs, cultures, and ideologies start to blur as humanity globalizes faster and faster. Within this fast paced world, it is imperative that one must learn how to adapt and coexist in differing cultures. This was a lesson I learned first-hand while working part-time at Zaxbys. On my first day at the job, to say I was overwhelmed would be an understatement. Sloshing oil, blaring music, and rapid fire Spanish all blew past me as I walked around the establishment’s kitchen. When I attempted to communicate orders to the kitchen, they would often get frustrated with me and my fast-paced english. I left my first shift from Zaxbys feeling defeated and like an absolute clutz. However, as I worked there longer and got used to the chaos in the fast food industry, I started to gain confidence in myself. Over time, I started picking up some Spanish vocabulary and grammar, to the point that I was able to communicate with my coworkers in short, rudimentary sentences. This was the experience that gave me a great improvement in my Spanish. Although I do not work over there now, the feeling of involvement and improvement, as well as the lessons in perseverance is not something I will forget anytime soon.

		   	In order to succeed in learning a language, networking skills are essential. You need to be able to find and locate native speakers, be able to make connections to people who speak your target language, and in general create a social circle to immerse yourself in. Without these skills, the farthest you can go is memorising grammar rules and vocabulary, having no way to try out and use the skills you studied so hard for. Unfortunately for me, I was quite introverted, and therefore lacked the sufficient skills needed to reach out to other fellow language learners. This left me in a deadlocked situation for quite a while, simply stuffing my brain with static knowledge and having no way to dynamically use it. Pondering ways to solve this, I called up an old friend who had learned Spanish over summer break. He introduced me to an application called discord, which consists of several niche servers, of which several language learning servers exist. I eagerly hopped on to a call full of fellow learners, who welcomed me in Spanish so fluent that I thought they were natives. Initially, I was quite intimidated, afraid to even talk. But as I listened to more and more conversations, I slowly but surely improved, and gained enough confidence to finally start talking. I entered the voice chat, and the learners greeted me again in Spanish. But this time, I had the courage to respond back.

		   	I believe that shared passions have the potential to bring people together like nothing else in the world. Passions strong enough to people can talk about them for hours before realizing the time. As you may have realized, my passion is language learning and linguistics, and nearly one year ago, I was eager to share it with the world. On one beautiful day, I created one of my favorite places in FCHS: the Language Learning community. It was a club where fellow language lovers could gather and share resources on our respective journeys, almost like a language caravan. At the beginning it was a bit difficult to recruit members into our club, but thanks to my friends' aggressive marketing tactics, I managed to increase our community to over 15 members. For our meetings, we come together to discuss each of our languages and what we have done to improve in them, and we give feedback to those we can. We then divide into smaller groups based on our target languages, where we each recommend different resources and study tactics to each other. Through this relatively simple club structure, we as a club have expanded more than I ever thought we could, and have made a closely knitted community in the process. I plan on investing more time into this club, and look forward to its future.

Everything from politics to community involvement, Ifemelu is an extremely involved woman. From actively supporting Obama’s campaign to giving money to her family in Nigeria, Ifemelu is involved in a variety of fields. Within the theme of Getting involved, Adichie mainly focuses on political activism and expectations of remittances from immigrants
In chapter 39,  Ifemelu campaigns for Obama and his policies on her blog, saying,““This Is Why Obama Will Do It Better,” often adding links to his website, and she blogged, too, about Michelle Obama.” Ifemelu’s constant blogging of Obama’s campaign once again reinforces Obama’s position as a symbol of hope within the mindsets of black folk, showing how involved Ifemelu can get for the sake of a black candidate for the president of the United States. Ifemelu’s community involvement shows a strong passion for the sake of empowerment for black children and blacks as a whole. This was best seen when Dike said, “I can't believe it. My president is black like me.” Dike saying that also reveals his American identity, and how he believes that he too is an African American rather than an African. 
In chapter 16, Ifemelu remarks about how she can send money home to Nigeria, to her parents, “It would not have occurred to Ifemelu to refuse the check; now she could pay some bills, send something home to her parents.” Even while struggling to pay bills, Ifemelu considers giving her family a portion of the money first, putting her family before her in terms of well-being. This is a mindset commonly shared among first generation immigrants, who put the burden of their family’s well being upon themselves. This can be caused by the fact that the first generation immigrant tends to be the richest person in the family, even though objectively they might be poor, even poverty stricken in some cases.

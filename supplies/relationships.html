I recently moved, and to my utter horror, my mom randomly posted "My highschooler is learning japanese. Are there any Japanese people in the neighborhood who'd be willing to let him practice?" in some sort of facebook group for the new neighborhood.
A lady who lives about a block away responded and said that her mom is Japanese and that they both speak it. Honestly I was pretty intimidated, I've talked to a friend on the phone once before for like 10 or 15 minutes, but this is real life. 
I went over to their house today and was greeted by two super energetic kids, their mom, and grandmother. They were all super nice and their kids were having a blast. I sat down at their table and we started speaking. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it was due to me being a bit nervous, but my speaking skills seemed to just utterly stop. Luckily the grandmother was really talkative and pretty funny, she wasn't too hard to understand but her daughter would give me a quick run down if I hadn't caught everything she said. I was still able to give some good answers in Japanese, despite my nerves and having to default to english sometimes. Normally the conversation went 10-20 sentences in japanese and then 1-2 in english and then back to japanese. They brought out some snacks and we talked about Japanese food for a bit, then college and japan. The grandmother mentioned something about missing Japanese traditions/culture and she seemed overjoyed that there was someone there who wanted to take part.
This whole experience was great and is a pretty huge motivator for me to keep studying. Nothing motivates better than noticing you have work to do. When I got home I went straight to studying and got a good amount done. Turns out my mom reaching out was a good idea and we all had a lot of fun.

		   	Most people volunteer to put it on their college applications, or to complete requirements set by their schools. But as a new kid in a new school, I volunteered for one reason and one reason only: to find and make new friends. When I was in eighth grade, I had just moved to Cumming and it was the summer before I would make my debut at Otwell Middle School. As a bid to possibly meet some of my future classmates over there, I chose to volunteer at the local food drive, where we would package food for the underprivileged. As my mom drove me to the school, my heart started pounding as I thought what would happen if I was not able to find someone to group with. As we reached the front office and my mom waved me bye, I gulped down my fear and entered the bustling cafeteria. As I scanned the area for kids my age, I heard a hindi greeting behind me. At the door of the cafeteria stood a lanky Indian kid, making up one of the two other Indian kids present. I returned the greeting and we conversed in Hindi for a while. The kid's name was Sai, an extroverted, boastful fellow eighth grader. We had a nice dynamic, with him playfully making fun of my accented Hindi and me quipping about his shoes back. I had a blast at Otwell that day and made my first friend of the year.

		   	Of my years working as a Japanese translator, one of my most fond memories is meeting my best friend, Dave. The story starts in eighth grade, when I had just started learning the Japanese language. I was reviewing the applications of grammatical particles when Davel, back then my seatmate in Spanish class, came up behind me and asked what I was reading. When I told him, he also explained that he had a strong interest in Japanese culture and whether it was fine if he could learn along with me. To be honest, such a question left me dumbfounded, as it was the first time I had met someone even remotely interested in Japan. After a momentary double take, I ecstatically exclaimed “Yes!” and introduced him to the grammar resource I was reading. Fast forward four years and Dave and I remain the best of friends. Even though we go to different high schools, our mutual love for the arts and foreign cultures keep us in touch. Now that our Japanese skills have matured along with us, we use the abilities we cultivated in Spanish class to translate a variety of media, from comic books to comedy shows to animations and movies. As we grow older, I hope to further grow closer friends with our love for the foreign arts.

Throughout Americanah, Ifemelu makes many close connections to various people, whether it be romantic or platonic. Within the theme of Relationships, Adichie mainly explores the reason for romantic relationships and friendship.
In chapter 16, Ifemelu remarks about Kimberly the following: “‘It’s a phase. It will pass, you’ll see.’ She felt protective of Kimberly, she wanted to shield Kimberly.” This quote describes the sense of friendship between Kimberly and Ifemelu. Each woman compliments the other’s world view in terms of the effect of race on the mindset of black Americans and how American parenting differs from Nigerian parenting. Through this unique dynamic, Kimberly and Ifemelu forge a strong bond with each other and help each other with a variety of issues, financial issues for Ifemelu and emotional issues for Kimberly. Ifemelu also notes how Morgan rebelling against Kimberly can be a sign of her testing her: “Morgan just needed to feel that her mother could push back.” This goes back to the theme of American parenting and Nigerian parenting, and how each differs in strictness.
In chapter 34, Ifemelu talks about how she and her boyfriend, Blaine, see race differently, as she was born in Africa while Blaine was born and raised in the US. Ifemelu thinks that, “[Blaine] expected her to feel what she did not know how to feel.” as she is an outsider to the racial dynamic in the United States. This difference in opinion is the first sign of rift between their relationship, as different political and emotional differences pile up, resulting in their breakup.

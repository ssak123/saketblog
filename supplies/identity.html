		   Language and Culture are inextricably linked. Without knowing the language, you can never 
fully understand the small nuances and undertones that make up a culture. Which is why it 
pains me, as a proud Indian American, to say that my Hindi is complete garbage. Whether it’s
me mispronouncing a long word or using the wrong masculine conjugation of a verb, it is safe to 
say that my Hindi is lacking both in terms of vocabulary and grammar. It’s gotten to the point that
my relatives refer to the grotesque amalgamation of Hindi and English that I speak with a
special word: “Hinglish”. Although my terrible Hindi makes for some funny conversations during 
family reunions, it also leaves me quite isolated from my Indian peers. The struggle in 
communications along with the sheer amount of Indians I talk to on a daily basis compound to 
create a perfect storm of insecurity and feelings of inadequacy. It feels as though I am being 
alienated from my own culture that I was born in. However, since then, I have managed to 
greatly improve my Hindi, especially in terms of pronunciation and grammar. Except for the
 slight American accent, I can proudly say that my Hindi is nearly indistinguishable from the
 average Indian’s. Thanks to this language learning experience, I can finally speak with 
confidence around my countrymen, and get back in touch with the culture that I had nearly lost.

	   	<p class="paragraph-text">In the West, India is often seen as a land of one ethnically and culturally homogeneous population. All Indians celebrate one “Indian” culture, eat “Indian” cuisines, and wear “Indian” clothes. As an Indian American growing up surrounded by these opinions, I too once believed that was the case. I thought that all Indians spoke Hindi like me, ate roti like me, and loved chicken like me. That all changed when I met my friend Sujai. On the outside, he looked almost exactly like me: wide eyes, caramel skin, black hair. But, as I would soon discover, the similarities ended there. Sujai was a Christian from Andhra Pradesh, a Telugu speaking region in India known for its sizable Christian population. As a Hindi speaking Hindu, this came as a shock to me, knowing that a fellow Indian could be so different from me. Ever since that encounter, I have made it my mission to expose myself to as many parts of India as I can. Since then, I have met people from the strong, wealthy Western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra to people from the ancient Dravidian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Meeting these people, I realize that India is not the monolithic culture Western media portrays it as. It is a diverse mix of different ethnic groups and languages that mesh together to form the umbrella identity known as “Indian”. <br><br><br></p>

	   	<p class="paragraph-text"> As an Indian person living in America, I often feel as though my identity is split. Facing expectations to be loyal to the old world Indian identity and fluent in the new American identity, sometimes the pssure from both sides can be crushing. Being considered Indian by Americans and American by Indians can make it seem as though I inhabit a gray area between two cultures. This gray area inspires a specific type of loneliness that only fellow immigrants can understand. The loneliness of being simultaneously immersed and distanced in the culture you are expected to thrive in. However, like many of my brethren, I have learned to take pride in this gray area, to be proud of my status as a bridge between two cultures. Rather than fit into a single mold based on national identity, I have learned to take various aspects from different cultures and fuse it into my own, creating a new synthetic culture unique to me only. It was in fact this search for an identity that led me to my interest in foreign cultures, allowing me to discover my passion for the subject. Through my love of foreign culture, I managed to find a new self and create a more complete me.  <br><br><br></p>

		   	In the book Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie explores the hardships of daily immigrant life in America. The book often directly speaks to sensitive issues such as racism, the aftermath of colonization, and the mistreatment of immigrants in America. Adichie uses the main character, Ifemelu, as an instrument to show these issues through a first-hand lens. Within the theme of identity, Adichie mainly focuses on the incomplete identities of immigrants, loss of culture through conformation, and how Blacks are perceived in America.     
In chapter 44, Ife’s close friend Ranyinudo teases her about her Americanized view on the world and how she is, “not even a real Americanah.” Ranyinudo goes on to say that, ” At least if you had an American accent we would tolerate your complaining!” Ifemelu’s Nigerian friend noticing her lack of a concrete identity illustrates a common sentiment shared by several immigrants living in America and Western Europe. It is the feeling of being neither an American nor a part of their homeland, which results in them being in a gray, inbetween area, where they are neither fully American nor fully foreign. 
In chapter 19, while Ifemelu is straightening her hair, she feels a strange sense of loss: “While the hairdresser had flat-ironed the ends, the smell of burning, of something organic dying which should not have died, had made her feel a sense of loss.” This quote suggests that immigrant women often have to sacrifice their cultural identity in order to be considered professional and conform to the status quo of western european beauty standards. Within the quote, Ifemelu is doing exactly that: changing a significant part of her identity (her hair) to please the majority white professional world. Throughout this process, Ifemelu feels a sense of loss, as her culture is being striped away from her through societal pressure for conformity in America.   
In chapter 21, Ifemelu writes on her blog the following: “Dear Non-American Black, when you make the choice to come to America, you become black. Stop arguing. Stop saying I’m Jamaican or I’m Ghanaian. America doesn’t care. So what if you weren’t “black” in your country? You’re in America now.” This quote highlights the monolith black Americans are perceived to be by the white majority, while also pointing out the fact that the United States is still a racialized society. This is due to the fact that most Americans subconsciously subdivide people based on their race.
